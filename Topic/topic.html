                <div>Topic 1: Talk about a friend</div>

                Hello, My name's Lộc.
                Today, I'm going to talk about a friend of mine. His name is Tung. You can spell it T-U-N-G. His
                full name is Do Thanh Tung. He's 19 years old, he's a student. He was born and raised in Bao Loc Lam
                Dong. He's quite handsome. He's taller than me and he has black hair with brown eyes. He likes to play
                games like me. We like the same kinds of games and movies. Me and Tung, we often play games together. We
                wear different kinds of clothes and we look different (Phần
                "look different" trên em tả rồi có thể bỏ nhưng cho vd cụ thể về style ăn mặc nha em). When i'm in
                trouble, I usually don't share it with others because I'm an very introverted person. But what I love
                most about Tung is he always notices and shares with me. Finally ,I want to thank Tung for being my
                friend.

                <div>Topic 2: Talk about your musical tastes</div>

                Hello teacher,My name is Loc.Today ,I'm going to talk about my musical taste. first of all, i'm a big
                fan of music and I listen to music almost every day when I have free time or when I want to relax
                myself. I’m not completely into any type of music specifically, I listen to the music that fits my
                mood.If I’m happy, I will listen to pop or hiphop. When i play games i will look for energetic music
                like EDM.And if i'm sad i will just listen to some lo-fi song.My favorite singers are billie eilish and
                Post Malone .I like these singers because the songs they sing always suit the mood and are very good. My
                favorite song right now is The Nights by Avicii ,I like it because it gives me good vibes .I often
                listen to music on my labtop and mobile phone. My favorite music website are spotify ,zing MP3 and
                youtube. I like those websites because it's easy and convenient. I never had a chance to go to a live
                concert but if I did, I would definitely go.
                That all, thank you for listening.
                don't have anything bad to say about this coffee shop but if I did, I wish it wouldn't be crowded on
                holidays I prefer a quieter space. Thank you for listening.

                <div> Topic 3: Your family.</div>

                In my family, there are four people. My father is an engineer, and my mother is a teacher. My father's
                name is John, and my mother's name is Mary.Yes, I have one brother. He is two years younger than me and
                currently studying in college. His name is Michael.My father is 52 years old, and my mother is 49. My
                brother is 20 years old.No, my brother is not married, and my sister is not married either.My father is
                tall and has a commanding presence, while my mother is of average height with a warm and friendly
                demeanor. Both of them have a kind and good-hearted nature.My brother is quite handsome, with a charming
                smile and a good sense of style.Yes, my sister is very pretty, with beautiful features and a cheerful

                equally, and each holds a special place in my heart.We often spend quality time together as a family. On
                weekends, we enjoy going on outings to parks, having meals at our favorite restaurants, and watching
                movies together. During holidays, we sometimes plan trips to explore new places and create lasting
                memories. Additionally, we often gather around the dining table for family dinners, where we share
                stories and catch up with each other's lives. These shared moments bring us closer and strengthen our
                bond as a family.

                <div> Topic 4: Your favorite restaurant.</div>

                Hello teacher, today I'm going to talk about my favorite coffee shop. I'm a person who doesn't like
                going out to eat or drink but there is one place that I for sure have to go to every Sunday with my
                friends and that is Pham Garden coffee. The location of the coffee is at 39 Nguyen Binh Khiem Street,
                Ward 2, Bao Loc Lam Dong. It takes about 5 minutes by motorbike from my house to the coffee shop. The
                menu of Pham Garden coffee includes espresso, tea, smoothies, ice cream, yogurt, and cakes. My favorite
                drink here is peach tea it -> which costs 25000VND. The service staff here is very attentive and
                enthusiastic, the price of the shop is also quite suitable for students, it ranges from 20000 VND to
                40000 VND. I often go there with my friends because we can talk and play cards together. What I like
                about this coffee is that it has a lot of trees, fresh air, and wide-open space. I don't have anything
                bad to say about this coffee shop but if I did, I wish it wouldn't be crowded on holidays I prefer a
                quieter space. Thank you for listening.

                <div>TOPIC 1: WRITE ABOUT YOUR FAVORITE ELECTRONIC PRODUCT</div>
                My favorite electronic product is my smartphone.It cost me around $700 when I purchased it.The color of
                my smartphone is black.
                The brand of my smartphone is Samsung.I use my smartphone every day, almost constantly.
                It has become an essential part of my daily life.Overall, my smartphone makes my life easier.
                It allows me to stay connected with friends and family, access information
                and capture precious moments with its high-quality camera.I use my smartphone for various purposes,
                including communication through calls and messaging, social media browsing, email checking, web surfing,
                taking photos and videos, playing games, and managing my schedule with productivity apps.Fortunately,
                I haven't faced any significant problems with my smartphone so far. It has been reliable and performs
                well.
                The one thing I dislike about my smartphone is its battery life. While it gets me through the day with
                moderate usage,
                I wish it could last longer, especially during heavy use.Since I've had my smartphone for a few years
                now, I am considering upgrading to a newer model. The latest versions often come with improved features,
                better performance, and longer battery life, which would enhance my overall smartphone experience.
                However, I am also quite attached to my current device, as it has served me well and has sentimental
                value. So, I am still contemplating the decision to upgrade.

                <div> Topic 2 : Your fitness and eating habits..</div>

                Hello teacher, my name is …Lộc…. I’m …20… years old. I’m a student in FPOLY. Today I will talk about my
                fitness and eating habits. I think health has meaning in life. Because when the body remains healthy and
                the mind is active and fresh, it will extend our life and make our life happier. In order to have good
                health, we must keep fit and eat in moderation. I don’t have a good shape. I’m a couch potato. I don't
                exercise often but sometimes I do play some sports like badminton swimming to stay in shape. I play
                badminton at my friend's house and swim in the pool near my house. I usually play badminton every
                weekend with my friends and sometimes when the weather is nice we will switch to swimming. Some healthy
                eating habits are Eating a variety of fruits and vegetables, Eating high-fiber bread, and cereals, and
                Drinking fat-free or low-fat milk. Some unhealthy eating habits are eating too fast, skipping meals,
                eating junk food and greasy food. I eat vegetables and fruits to stay in shape. I usually eat fruits and
                vegetables every day. I like to drink milk and smoothies. The type of food that I avoid is greasy food.
                We should avoid fast food because it will make us addicted and gain weight very quickly. It's important
                to stay fit because it reduces the risk of injuries, and improves the quality of life and health. I
                sleep 7 hours a day. I go to bed at 11 o'clock. That’s all about my topic. Thank you for listening.

                Hello teacher, my name is …Loc…. I’m …20…… years old. I’m a student in FPOLY. Today I will talk about my
                recent vacation. I usually travel 1 to 2 times a year. My last vacation trip is to ·dalat. I went there
                with my friends. We went there by motorbike. I stayed there for 2 days and 1 night. At a homestay near
                Dalat city center. the food here is great and affordable. The weather was not very good , it was a bit
                foggy and rain. Da Lat is famous for its food, poetic scenery, and fresh air. My friends and I went
                sightseeing around, hunting clouds and enjoyed Dalat cuisine. My friends and I went sightseeing around,
                hunting clouds and enjoyed Dalat cuisine. What I like most about my vacation is that I can go out with
                my friends to relax my mind and enjoy the fresh air of Dalat. I enjoyed my time in dalat, I like
                everything here, the atmosphere, the food, and the people. I have some bad experience with the weather.
                The weather during my time in Da Lat was not very nice. maybe someday when the weather is better I will
                come back here and enjoy Dalat to the fullest. That’s all about my topic. Thank you for listening.

                comfortable and confident. Today i wear jeans and a t-shirt. I've never worn a dress because it doesn't
                match my gender. I offten by clothes online because it's easier and more convenient. Usually, I would
                buy my clothes but sometimes my mother would do it. I hardly ever go shopping, I only buy clothes on
                special occasions. We should wear formal clothes to the wedding party to show respect to the host. I m
                currently a student in Fpoly and my school doesn't need to wear school uniforms. My school uniform is an
                orange polo shirt. Usually, most schools in Vietnam will make their students wear a school uniform, but
                some schools allow students to wear shorts to school. I feel proud to wear a school uniform

                <div> Topic 1: Your favorite means of transportation</div>

                Hello teacher, my name is …………. I’m ………… years old. I’m a student in FPOLY. Today I will talk about my
                favorite means of transportation and my travel plan.I live in Ho Chi Minh City it’s a large city with a
                large population and a variety of means of transportation . Some of the main means of transportation
                here are buses, motorbikes, cars,... My favorite means of transportation is also the one I currently use
                right now a motorbike. Because the roads in Ho Chi Minh City are pretty busy, I think a motorbike is a
                good choice in the current situation . What I love most about the motorbike is that it is small and
                convenient for me to commute in some narrow streets. I don't know if I have a problem with my motorbike,
                if it is, it must be a waste of gas and the price of gas is quite high right now. I go to school by
                motorbike. it takes about 30 minutes from my house to school. I ride a motorbike almost every day, I use
                it to go to school, and go out, but sometimes the car breaks down, I can change to the bus. Normally, I
                would ride a motorbike with my friends back to my hometown. In the next trip I think I will go to Dalat.
                I will go with my friend. I plan to go there by motorbike. I will stay there for 2 days and 1 night. I
                chose that destination because I heard that it is a place with beautiful scenery along with fresh air
                and delicious food. I will go around Dalat and explore the food and nature here

                <div>Topic 2: Your shopping habits.</div>


                Hello teacher, my name is Loc I’m 20 years old. I’m a student in Fpoly. Today I’m will talk about my
                shopping habits. I love shopping because it helps me relax and relieve stress. I usually buy clothes at
                stores near my house. I offten shop online 1 to 2 times a week. I usually buy household appliances and
                electronic devices online. My favorite website to shop online is shopee because it's very easy and
                convenient. When shopping online I usually look at the price and reviews of previous shoppers. I usually
                pay by card, I like to pay by card because it's convenient. I love to buy things on sale because it can
                save me money. When I go to the market I often bargain because it can help me to get a cheaper price. I
                had one bad experience with online shopping that when i bought a shirt online but when it arrived it was
                another shirt with very bad quality. I prefer to shop at the store because I can see and rate the
                product directly

                <div>Topic 3: Vietnamese gestures and customs</div>

                Vietnamese gestures and customs hold great significance in the country's cultural identity. When meeting
                someone for the first time, a warm smile accompanied by a bow or nod is a common way to greet each
                other. Respect for elders is deeply ingrained, and using specific honorifics and bowing are customary
                when addressing them. For peers and younger individuals, a friendly nod or a simple "xin chào" suffices.
                Handshakes are used in formal and business settings, often presented with both hands as a sign of
                respect. In the business world, exchanging business cards is a polite practice, done with both hands,
                and cards are read and acknowledged before being put away. Topics for small talk often revolve around
                family, health, and general well-being, while sensitive subjects are best avoided. To indicate numbers
                or point at someone, open hands are commonly used. Overall, understanding and embracing these gestures
                and customs will foster positive interactions and showcase cultural appreciation in Vietnam.

                <div>Topic 4: Your favorite movie</div>

                - Hello teacher, my name is Loc Today, I would like to talk about my favorite movie.
                - I’m a huge movie enthusiast, so I love experiencing various types of movies since I was a kid. I'm
                very interested in action, sci-fi and thought-provoking movies. one of my favorite movies is avengers
                endgame, I like it because I'm a big fan of superhero movies. Endgame is a great movie, it exceeded my
                expectations, from the visual effects, and the sound to the thrilling action scenes, it left a deep
                impression on me. Endgame is a movie in the genre of action and science fiction. The plot was about a
                group of superheroes trying to protect not only the Earth but also other planets from the brink of
                destruction from the evil Thanos and his army. Endgame is a 3-hour movie released in April 2019 with the
                participation of famous cast such as Elizabeth Olsen, Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth and Tom Holland.
                My favorite character in the movie is Iron Man by Robert Downey Jr. My friends and I went to see the
                movie at the cinema right after it was released. I love eating popcorn and drinking soda while watching
                movies. I didn't learn anything from the movie but it brought me a fun and relaxing time. I only watched
                the movie once but I will definitely watch it again in the future. That is the end of my speaking. Thank
                you for your listening

                <div> Topic 1: Talk about a hotel you have stayed in</div>

                Hello teacher, my name is … Today, I would like to talk about a hotel that I have stayed in during my
                trip to Danang a few years ago. The hotel's name is Minh Quan. It is located near My Khe beach that has
                been recognized as one of the most popular attractions in the world. the location of the hotel is great
                it's very easy and convenient to go around and explore da Nang. I stayed in a single bedroom which cost
                about 600k per night. The room has a single bed, a TV, a bathroom and a minibar which some bottles of
                water in it. The hotel I stayed at has a lot of SERVICES & FACILITIES such as swimming pool, gym,
                housekeeping, wake up. I used the hotel's housekeeping and laundry service. I felt very comfortable and
                satisfied with my stay. What I like the most here is the staff here are extremely hospitable and
                friendly. I have nothing bad to say about this hotel from facilities to service, everything is perfect
                but it would be even better if its price could be reduced a litter bit. Minh Quan is a great hotel. If I
                have a chance to come to Danang again, I will definitely come back and stay there. That is the end of my
                speaking. Thank you for your listening.

                <div> Topic 2: Talk about good and bad driving habits</div>

                Hello teachers,My name is Loc . Today, I would like to talk about good and bad driving habits.. First of
                all,I want to share with you my riding experience.I can ride a motorbike.I have known how to ride a
                motorbike since I was fifteen years old. I have a motorbike at home. I’m a good motorbike rider.
                Secondly, I would like to talk about good and bad driving habits. The example of good driving habits are
                always paying attention, Observe the speed limit and Maintain a safe following distance. ,...Some
                example of bad driving habits are tailgate,not signal when turning, Not stop at red lights... I think
                the most dangerous driving habit is to pass in the no-pass zone because it is easy to cause an accident.
                The driving habits I usually have is pay attention,maintain a safe following distance when driving.
                Finally it is about an accident that i’ve seen recently. The accident happened a few month ago on Lac
                Long Quan Street . there was a motorbike speeding without wearing a helmet.After that,he fell on the
                road. Luckily it didn't cause too much damage. I was on my way home when I saw the accident. Some people
                and I came and helped that guy I learned that we should always wear a helmet and not speeding. In
                conclusion, I would say that people must drive carefully to be safe, avoid bad driving habits to avoid
                unexpected accidents . That's all.Thanks for your listening.

                <div> Topic 3: Talk about how you take care of your appearance</div>
                Hello teacher, my name is … Today, I would like to talk about how i take care of my appearance. I think
                appearance is a very important thing, it is what people often use to judge a person and if we have a
                good look, it will help us to be more confident about ourselves. So everyone should know how to take
                care of their appearance. I often take care of my appearance every day. I am very satisfied with my
                appearance. I take care of my skin, hair and teeth by brushing my teeth twice a day and showering at
                least once a day. My personal care products i use are cetaphil cleanser, ps toothpaste and xmen shampoo.
                I don't spend too much money on cosmetic products. I usually go to the barber shop once every 3 weeks.
                My favorite barber shop is Vu Tri it is located on Nguyen Thi Nho Street, Tan Binh District. I go there
                alone.I usually get a hair cut, with costs about 80k. I have no problem with plastic surgery, if it
                helps you to look better and feel more confident about yourself, I will welcome it. The advantage of
                plastic surgery is that it will help you overcome your shortcomings and have a better appearance. The
                disadvantage of plastic surgery is that it is very dangerous and can affect your health, but with the
                development of current technology, that is being minimized. If I had money, I wouldn't have had plastic
                surgery because I'm very satisfied with my current look. That's all.Thanks for your listening.

                <div> Topic 4: Your eating habits</div>

                Hello teacher, my name is …Lộc…. I’m …20… years old. I’m a student in FPOLY. Today I will talk about my
                fitness and eating habits. I think health has meaning in life. Because when the body remains healthy and
                the mind is active and fresh, it will extend our life and make our life happier. In order to have good
                health, we must keep fit and eat in moderation. I don’t have a good shape. I’m a couch potato. I don't
                exercise often but sometimes I do play some sports like badminton swimming to stay in shape. I play
                badminton at my friend's house and swim in the pool near my house. I usually play badminton every
                weekend with my friends and sometimes when the weather is nice we will switch to swimming. Some healthy
                eating habits are Eating a variety of fruits and vegetables, Eating high-fiber bread, and cereals, and
                Drinking fat-free or low-fat milk. Some unhealthy eating habits are eating too fast, skipping meals,
                eating junk food and greasy food. I eat vegetables and fruits to stay in shape. I usually eat fruits and
                vegetables every day. I like to drink milk and smoothies. The type of food that I avoid is greasy food.
                We should avoid fast food because it will make us addicted and gain weight very quickly. It's important
                to stay fit because it reduces the risk of injuries, and improves the quality of life and health. I
                sleep 7 hours a day. I go to bed at 11 o'clock. That’s all about my topic. Thank you for listening.
